# Belly Button Biodiversity

For this project, I created an interactive dashboard hosted on Git Hub. It allows the user to select a number from the dropdown menu and see three charts (a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart, and a gauge chart). Upon selecting a number, the user will see information pertaining to the types and amount of bacteria found in the belly buttons of people and their wash frequency. Interestingly, the more often a person washes their navel, the more bacteria are found. 

This is an interactive site. I used JavaScript, Plotly, and D3 to create the logic and webpage. Additionally, I used CSS and Bootstrap to stylize the webpage for the dashboard.
